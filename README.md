Hotel Bookings Analyzer - A data analysis project about hotel bookings

# Classification problem

The goal of the project is to analyze a business problem related to hotel bookings by using the CRISP-DM process.
One important classification problem to be solved is to recognize when a booking will be cancelled based on various factors. This could prevent customer churn and provide a better experience for the guests.
Therefore, a machine learning model is used for this task.

# Dataset
The used dataset for this project is [Hotel Booking Demand from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
The data should be downloaded and placed in the "data" directory, which is inside the "src" directory ('src/data/hotel_bookings.csv').
